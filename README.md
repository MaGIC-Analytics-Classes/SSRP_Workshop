# Workshop on introductory NGS/Bioinformatics with interactive RNA-seq session
Welcome to this quick workshop to introduce you to NGS/Bioinformatics for the SSRP program. 
We will cover the basics of Next Generation Sequencing and bioinformatics of such data, including resources at Rutgers that can be of most assistance including:
- [The Genomics Core](http://research.njms.rutgers.edu/genomics/)
- [Amarel @ OARC](https://oarc.rutgers.edu/amarel/)
- [The Molecular and Genomics Informatics Core (your host today)](https://ru-magic.github.io/MaGIC/)

*This workshop is not meant to be comprehensive, but to serve as a baseline. Continued education opportunities are available through full courses*
